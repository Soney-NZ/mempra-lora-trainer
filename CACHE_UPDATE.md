# Cache Directory Update

## Changes Made

After removing the persistent cache folder, the production handler has been updated to work without persistent storage:

### Handler Changes
- **Cache Directory**: Changed from `/workspace/model_cache` to `/tmp/model_cache` 
- **Initialization**: Lightweight model availability check instead of full download
- **Download Strategy**: Models download on-demand during training jobs
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced initial memory footprint

### Dockerfile Changes  
- **Directory Creation**: Uses `/tmp/model_cache` instead of `/workspace/model_cache`
- **Permissions**: Maintains proper permissions for temporary storage
- **No Persistent Storage**: Container is stateless and ephemeral

### Benefits
✅ **Faster Startup**: No large model downloads during initialization
✅ **Lower Memory**: Reduced initial container memory usage  
✅ **Stateless**: Containers are truly ephemeral and scalable
✅ **On-Demand**: Models download only when needed for training

### How It Works Now
1. **Container Starts**: Quick health check setup, no model downloads
2. **Training Request**: Model downloads automatically during job execution
3. **Container Ends**: No persistent data, clean slate for next job

This approach is more aligned with serverless best practices and RunPod's ephemeral worker model.
