# RunPod LoRA Training Endpoint Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues in This Version

### 1. Build Errors Fixed âœ…
- **Path Issue**: Fixed `chmod +x start.sh` path error in Dockerfile
- **Dependencies**: Updated aiohttp to stable 3.10.11 version
- **Constraints**: Added proper version pinning to avoid conflicts

### 2. Updated Configuration

#### Dockerfile Changes:
- Fixed start.sh path references (was `/start.sh`, now `./start.sh`)
- Updated pip installation strategy for better compatibility
- Added missing system dependencies

#### Dependencies Updated:
- `aiohttp`: Changed from 3.12.3 to 3.10.11 (more stable)
- Added proper constraints for compatibility
- Removed overly strict version locks that caused conflicts

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Upload all files** from `/runpod-setup/` to your RunPod endpoint
2. **Build the container** - it should now complete successfully
3. **Test the endpoint** with a small training job
4. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues

## Key Files:
- `Dockerfile` - Container definition with fixes
- `requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies
- `constraints.txt` - Version constraints
- `handler.py` - Main training handler
- `start.sh` - Startup script (now properly referenced)
- `healthcheck.py` - Health monitoring endpoints

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST your-endpoint-url/runsync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"test": true}}'
```

Should return a successful response without build errors.
